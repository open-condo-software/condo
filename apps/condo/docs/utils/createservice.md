createservice util
=====

Creates a scaffold for a custom GraphQL mutation or query.

```shell
yarn workspace @app/${APP} createservice --help
```

Where `${APP}` is a name of an application in `apps/`, where a custom query or mutation will be generated.
For example, `apps/condo` has a name `@app/condo`, specified in `apps/condo/package.json` as a Yarn workspace.

To create a `CustomUserActionService.js` module, that will be saved to `domains/user/schema`, a following command should be executed:

```shell
yarn workspace @app/condo createservice user.CustomUserActionService --type queries
```

Pay attention to following:
- domain name should start with lower case, so we have `user`
- service name should end with `Service` postfix, so we have `CustomUserActionService`

After successful execution of this command, you will get a new module in `apps/[APP]/<domain>/schema` folder

Don't delete automatically generated comment "Generated byâ€¦" in resulting module.

Look carefully at errors of this generator, in most cases they are self-explanatory.
