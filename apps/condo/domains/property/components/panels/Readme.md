## Folder contains all panels from the property page

For now, there are only 2 panels: 
1. Builder panel - where we design the structure of a property: sections, floors, units (flats) ...
1. Resident panel - a place where we gather all information about people who live in flats
1. General information - this panel is in TODO

Each panel can have read and edit mode.
