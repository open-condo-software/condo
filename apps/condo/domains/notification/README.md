# notifications

This domain contains all notification logic. 

Notification is a typed message which send to the user by transport.

Features:
 - all messages stored in DB for debugging
 - all message template logic hidden inside message.type
 - each message type have own template meta variables
 - we can change template logic in a future. Store it inside DB or in somewhere else.
 - support different transport (email, sms, push, ...)
 - sending messages by worker process
 - we can filter all messages related to some user or organization
 - we can deliver a message by user preferred transport (not implemented yet)
 - user can ignore some messages types if want (not implemented yet)

Everything you needed is to call `sendMessage` inside your code.

# server side logic example

```javascript

const { COUNTRIES, DEFAULT_ENGLISH_COUNTRY } = require('@condo/domains/common/constants/countries')

const { INVITE_NEW_EMPLOYEE_MESSAGE_TYPE } = require('@condo/domains/notification/constants')
const { sendMessage } = require('@condo/domains/notification/utils/serverSchema')

...

const InviteNewOrganizationEmployeeService = new GQLCustomSchema('InviteNewOrganizationEmployeeService', {
    ...
    const organization = ..
    const user = ..
    const employee = ..

    ...
    const lang = (COUNTRIES[organization.country] || COUNTRIES[DEFAULT_ENGLISH_COUNTRY]).locale
    await sendMessage(context, {
       lang,
       to: { user },
       type: INVITE_NEW_EMPLOYEE_MESSAGE_TYPE,
       meta: {
           organizationName: organization.name,
           inviteCode: employee.inviteCode,
       },
       organization: { id: organiation.id },
    })
    ...
})
...

```

# test and debug

You can use `NOTIFICATION__SEND_ALL_MESSAGES_TO_CONSOLE` environment 
to fake transport.send() logic and display message context in console.

Debug and test purposes!

If you want to run tests inside your IDE with fake express server and in the same process worker
and display all transport messages in console use:

`.env`:
```
TESTS_FAKE_CLIENT_MODE=true
TESTS_FAKE_WORKER_MODE=true
NOTIFICATION__SEND_ALL_MESSAGES_TO_CONSOLE=true
```
