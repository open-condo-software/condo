This method retrieves all [progress bar notifications](/docs/bridge/methods/notifications/show-progress-bar)
that have not already been closed by the user.
If you use these notifications in your mini-app, it is recommended to call this method every time mini-app is started to keep your tasks in sync.
(close obsolete notifications, add new ones in case of session/user browser changes).
