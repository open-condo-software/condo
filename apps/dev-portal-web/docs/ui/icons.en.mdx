In addition to the core components, the Condo UI design system has its own [icon set](https://condo.d.doma.ai/ui/index.html?path=/story/icons--icons),
which is packed into the React component set and available for use as a separate npm package.

## Installation
To add a set of icons to your JS project, run one of the following commands according to your package manager:

<Tabs labels={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    ```bash
    npm i @open-condo/icons
    ```
    ```bash
    yarn add @open-condo/icons
    ```
    ```bash
    pnpm i @open-condo/icons
    ```
</Tabs>

## Basic usage
```typescript jsx
import { Wallet } from '@open-condo/icons'

<Wallet/>
```

Each icon from the Condo UI is presented in 4 sizes:

- `large` (24px x 24px)
- `medium` (20px x 20px)
- `small` (16px x 16px)
- `auto` (1em x 1em)

By default, all icons come in `large` size. You can change the size of the icon using the `size` property:

```typescript jsx
import { Star } from '@open-condo/icons'

<Star size='small'/>
```

## Changing icon color
The icons can be colored.
To accomplish this, the rule `fill: currentColor` is applied to the `svg` element.
In other words, the color is adjusted to the current value of the CSS property `color` of the parent element.

```typescript jsx
import { Mail } from '@open-condo/icons'

<Mail color='#39ce66'/>
```
