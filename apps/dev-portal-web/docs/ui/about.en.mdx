Condo UI is a library of adaptive React components that allows you to create mini-applications,
whose interface is similar to the Condo interface.

## Interactive sandbox

All Condo UI components can be found in our [interactive sandbox](https://condo.d.doma.ai/ui/index.html),
where you can see their behaviour, parameters and states (use the `A` key to display the control panel).

## Installation

To install the library, just run the following command according to your package manager:
<Tabs labels={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    ```bash
    npm i @open-condo/ui
    ```
    ```bash
    yarn add @open-condo/ui
    ```
    ```bash
    pnpm i @open-condo/ui
    ```
</Tabs>

You can then add the CSS styles of the Condo UI to your application to make all Condo UI components available for you to use:
```typescript
import '@open-condo/ui/dist/styles.min.css'
```


## Using the library

You can import the any required component as follows:

```typescript jsx
import { Button } from '@open-condo/ui'
import type { ButtonProps } from '@open-condo/ui'
```

In addition to components, the entire colour palette of Condo UI is also available in the library. You can get it either in the JS-object format,
or in the format of CSS variables along with other CSS tokens:
<Tabs labels={['JS-object', 'CSS-vars']}>
    ```typescript
    import { colors } from '@open-condo/ui/colors'
    ```
    ```typescript
    import '@open-condo/ui/style-vars/css'
    ```
</Tabs>
