## General Information
Management companies need to sell services and goods to their residents.
For example, employees of the management company can provide services for the repair of utilities and networks, as well as for the replacement and connection of equipment.
To allow residents to see the list of services, Condo has a Marketplace section (https://condo.d.doma.ai/marketplace).
This section groups the functionality for managing the storefront and invoices.

## Marketplace Setup
To use the Marketplace functionality, an initial setup is required (connect the Marketplace). There are two steps involved:
- In the first step, you must provide payment details for receiving payment for services, select the tax regime, and the VAT rate.
- In the second step, you need to specify a list of postal addresses to receive payment details and accept the offer. The accepted offer will be sent to the specified email.

    If the Marketplace is not set up, you will be prompted to do so.
