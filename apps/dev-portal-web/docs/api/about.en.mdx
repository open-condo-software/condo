The Condo API is based on a domain model consisting of objects and the relationships between them.
We use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) as our standard for building queries and manipulating data.
If you know how to make regular HTTP API queries and work with JSON, you shouldn't have too much trouble.

## Basic object properties

Our API is built around business or domain objects.
Each object has a set of mandatory properties:


| Property name | Property description     |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| id            | unique object identifier |
| __typename    | GraphQL object type      |

In addition, all objects have a number of utility properties:

| Attribute name | Attribute description                                                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| createdAt      | Object creation date, which cannot be overridden.  Sets automatically.                               |
| updatedAt      | The date of the last update of the object, which cannot be changed.  Sets automatically.             |
| deletedAt      | [Object deletion](/docs/api/soft-delete). It has null value if the object was not deleted yet.       |
| createdBy      | Reference to the user who created the object. Can't be changed, it's set automatically.              |
| newId          | Identifier of the object remaining after [object merge](/docs/api/merge)                             |
| dv             | [Version of data structure.](/docs/api/dv)                                                           |
| v              | version of the data, which is a counter that increases with any change of the object.                |
| importId       | The identifier of the external system, used when importing data into our service from other systems. |

## Methods to manipulate objects

All objects have a standard set of methods for working with them:

- Get all objects of a given type (query `allObjects`)
- Create a new object of this type (mutation `createObject`)
- Update an existing object (mutation `updateObject`)

<Alert type="info">
    For a particular type of object, the part with `Object` changes to the type of this object. Example: `allContacts`, `createTicket`, `updateUser`
</Alert>

## How do I figure it out?

We've prepared a couple of tools to make the developer's life easier when working with our API.

To orient yourself in our API, you can see the complete [graph of objects and links between them](https://condo.d.doma.ai/docs/graph).
We advise you to start exploring with tickets (`Ticket`), shared properties (`Property`) or organizations (`Organization`).
Or take a step-by-step tutorial on working with [API Playground](/docs/api/playground).

However, the easiest way to understand it is to look at the examples described in this section.
