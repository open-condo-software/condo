## Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text. \
Use backslash as a newline symbol...

or empty line for paragraph break.

## Emphasis
You can make texts look **bold** in __2 different ways__.
Text can also be *italic* in _2 different ways_.

However, it's recommended to use `*` symbol instead of `_`, since it makes texts in Pull Requests more readable.

You can also combine **bold** and *italic* texts at the same time by using 3 x `*`: \
***I need your attention :)***

As you can see above you can mark some parts of text as `inline code block`.

And ~Strikethrough~ modifiers are also ~~not~~ supported.

## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
> Some important quote goes here...

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
> This is an example
>
> of multi-paragraph block quotes

You can use other MDX syntax inside quotes (including quotes itself) as well:

> Some quote
>> Some nested quote with `code` and *bold text* inside

## Lists
### Ordered lists
Ordered lists are automatically detected by `X.` prefix:

1. Wake up
2. Coffee
3. Code time
1. You can use sequential numbers
1. Or just use "ones"

However, ...

57. List can also be started
1. with offset

### Unordered lists

- Item
- Item with sub-items
    - Sub-item

## Code blocks
Simple code block can be specified like following:

```
yarn add @open-condo/ui
```

But you can also specify programming language to enable code-highlighting

```bash
yarn add @open-condo/ui
```

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'

import { IconWrapper, IconProps } from '../wrappers'

export const Car: React.FC<IconProps> = ({ svgProps: props, ...restProps }) => {
    return (
        <IconWrapper
            icon={
                <svg
                    width='inherit'
                    height='inherit'
                    fill='none'
                    xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'
                    viewBox='0 0 24 24'
                    {...props}
                >
                    <path
                        fillRule='evenodd'
                        clipRule='evenodd'
                        d='M6.319 4a1 1 0 0 0-.92.606L3.518 11h16.966L18.6 4.606A1 1 0 0 0 17.681 4H6.32ZM21 13H3v6h18v-6Zm-2.95 8a2.5 2.5 0 0 0 4.95-.5V12a1 1 0 0 0-.08-.394l-2.481-7.788A3 3 0 0 0 17.68 2H6.32A3 3 0 0 0 3.56 3.818l-2.48 7.788A1 1 0 0 0 1 12v8.5a2.5 2.5 0 0 0 4.95.5h12.1ZM5 16a1 1 0 0 1 1-1h2a1 1 0 1 1 0 2H6a1 1 0 0 1-1-1Zm10 0a1 1 0 0 1 1-1h2a1 1 0 1 1 0 2h-2a1 1 0 0 1-1-1Z'

                </svg>
            }
            {...restProps}
        />
    )
}
```

## Links

You can also add links to your articles.

The most obvious way to do it is by adding url to your text: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-condo/bridge \
But it's highly recommended to use Markdown syntax to [cover your link with some readable text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-condo/bridge) \
Links [with custom hover texts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-condo/ui "Wow, that library is really awesome!") are supported as well.

> **Quick note:** by default all links are treated as external, so clicking it will lead to opening new browser tab.
>
> To link another doc-page use `/docs/...` syntax without a locale. This syntax will be treated as localized next-link

And you can also specify email directly: GoofyGoober@doma.ai

However, auto-detection is not working with phones: +79999999999, but you can still make it with regular link [+7 (999) 999–99–99](tel:+79999999999)

## Images

Images can be be pasted with syntax similar to links:

![My image](https://i.imgur.com/tVzxjWc.jpg "Wow, image can have a title too!")

## GFM syntax

Our MDX includes GFM, so you can use it's syntax as well

### Tables

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| path   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

Right aligned columns

| Option | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |


### HR

### Checkboxes

- [x] Checked item
- [ ] Unchecked item

## MDX syntax

MDX file extension allows you to use JSX Components inside markdown files.
We're limiting it to subset of components from [Condo UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-condo/ui) in order to decrease bundle and page sizes.

Here's a quick example how to use it:

<Alert
    message={'Alert title!'}
    description={'Note that import is not needed here. MDX processor handles all mappings by itself.'}
    type={'info'}
    showIcon
/>

## MD Playground

Currently, we have no playground for MDX syntax, but you can still preview your MD page
in [Condo UI Markdown playground](https://condo.d.doma.ai/ui/index.html?path=/story/components-markdown--markdown) with few limitations:

- MDX components are not supported here
- GFM syntax is included
- Code blocks are shown without syntax highlighting
