All reusable function which is not related to domain logic.

You can read more detail about domain logic in the [domains/README](../../README.md) file.

If it's client side logic utils function please put it inside a related 
`/<domain>/components` component.

We also have specific domain utilities and helpers 
for server side domain logic (`serverSchema`),
client side domain data-fetching logic (`clientSchema`) and 
server side tests logic utilities (`testSchema`)
