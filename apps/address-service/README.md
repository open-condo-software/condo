# Description
It's a separate service for address processing.

Each property is presented as the Address model instance. Each address may be found by different strings, so several AddressSource model instances may belong to each address.

## Models
- **Address**. A model containing data on the particular building's address.
- **AddressSource**. A model containing data on the particular building's address origin.
- **AddressInjection**. Addresses that do not exist in external providers.

## Endpoints

### /suggest
Used to get a list of suggestions while the user trying to add a new property. There is an ability to use different suggestions providers. If some property still not exists in external providers, we may inject proper data before the answer is sent to the response. It may be reached by adding new AddressInjection model via admin interface.

### /search
Should be used to get info about a single address by source (it's a cache) or some uuid. This endpoint utilizes search plugins under the hood. The first not-empty plugin's result will send to the response.

# project structure

We use Domain Driven Design to distribute logic into the domain folders.
Read details [here](./domains/README.md).

Main folders:
 - `./<domain>/constants` -- contains various constants. Used on the client and server side
 - `./<domain>/gql` -- contains all GraphQL queries. Used on the server and client side
 - `./<domain>/components` -- contains react components. Used on the client side
 - `./<domain>/schema` -- keystone.js based domain models. The GQL API is formed based on these models. Used on the server side
 - `./<domain>/access` -- contains keystone.js access check logic. Used on the server side
 - `./<domain>/utils` -- some utilities functions for the client and server side
 - `./<domain>/utils/clientSchema` -- client side domain logic utilities
 - `./<domain>/utils/serverSchema` -- server side domain logic utilities
 - `./<domain>/utils/testSchema` -- server side test used domain logic utilities
 - `/lang` -- translations. Used on the client and server side
 - `/pages` -- next.js pages. Used on the client side
 - `/public` -- next.js static files like design images, icons
