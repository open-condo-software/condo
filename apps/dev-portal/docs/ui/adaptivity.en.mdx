To create adaptive pages and components, Condo UI provides developers with 2 React-hooks: `useContainerSize` and `useBreakpoints`.

## useContainerSize

This hook observes your container with `React.ref` and returns the dimensions of that container,
allowing you to modify its contents based on those dimensions:

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useContainerSize } from '@open-condo/ui/hooks'
const MIN_COL_WIDTH = 250

const CardGrid: React.FC = () => {
    const [{ width, height }, setRef] = useContainerSize()
    const cardsPerRow = Math.max(1, Math.floor(width / MIN_COL_WIDTH))

    return (
        <div className='my-container' ref={setRef}>
        {/*  ...   */}
        </div>
    )
}
```

## useBreakpoints
We divide all devices into 6 groups:

| Device category | Min. device width (px) |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| MOBILE_SMALL    | 0                      |
| MOBILE_LARGE    | 360                    |
| TABLET_SMALL    | 480                    |
| TABLET_LARGE    | 768                    |
| DESKTOP_SMALL   | 992                    |
| DESKTOP_LARGE   | 1200                   |

The `useBreakpoints` hook returns an object with all active breakpoints. This is what the data looks like for a window width of `900px`:
```typescript
import { useBreakpoints } from '@open-condo/ui/hooks'

const { breakpoints } = useBreakpoints()

console.log(breakpoints.MOBILE_SMALL) // true, 900px >= 0px
console.log(breakpoints.TABLET_LARGE) // true, 900px >= 768px
console.log(breakpoints.DESKTOP_SMALL) // false, 900px < 992px
```
Thus, to change the layout on all tablets, the following condition must be met:
```typescript
import { useBreakpoints } from '@open-condo/ui/hooks'

const { breakpoints } = useBreakpoints()

if (breakpoints.TABLET_SMALL && !breakpoints.DESKTOP_SMALL) {
    // at least small tablet, but not small desktop yet
}
```
<Alert type={'warning'}>
    Note that for mini-applications, the width of the window is not the size of the browser tab, but the size of the IFrame window in which the application is opened.
