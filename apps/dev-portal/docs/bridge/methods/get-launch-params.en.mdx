This method takes no parameters and returns the current users context.
The user context is required by the mini-application for session and interface management.

## Platforms
- B2B-Web

## Return value

If successful, you will receive a JSON object of the following type:
<Tabs labels={['Return type', 'Return exmaple']}>
    ```typescript
    type GetLaunchParamsData = {
    condoUserId: string | null                       // Current user ID
    condoUserType: 'staff' | 'resident'              // User type
    condoLocale: string                              // Current interface locale ("en" / "ru")
    condoContextEntity: 'Organization' | 'Resident'  // Context entity type
    condoContextEntityId: string | null              // Context entity ID
}
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "condoUserId": "8c427089-9392-4a3b-bdf5-db87ba516118",
      "condoUserType":"staff",
      "condoLocale":"en",
      "condoContextEntity":"Organization",

    }
    ```
</Tabs>

## About user type and context entity

The user type is simple. In B2B applications it is always an `staff`, in B2C applications it is a `resident`.

### condoContextEntity in B2B applications

A B2B application is always opened by an employee of some organization.
In this case you will get its ID in the field `condoContextEntityId` and `condoContextEntity` will always be set to `Organization`.
The user can be an employee of more than one organization, but the IFrame of the current mini-application is reloaded when it is changed in the main application interface.
So you can safely put a `CondoWebAppGetLaunchParams` handler on the page loader (`window.addEventListener("load", () => {...}))` in case of pure JS or `useEffect() => {...}, [])` in case of React).

<Alert type={'warning'}>
    Although the B2B app's IFrame is reloaded when the user/organisation changes, your app may still have cookies from the old user, as browser policy does not allow us to clear them for you. Therefore, when loading an application, you must compare the user from CondoWebAppGetLaunchParams with the current user and, in case of a mismatch, perform authorization
</Alert>

### condoContextEntity in B2C applications

A B2C application always opened by a resident. A resident can reside in several addresses (units), each of which corresponds to a different `Resident` entity, the id of which you can get
when opening the B2C application.

## Usage example
```typescript jsx
import '@/styles/globals.css'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'

import bridge from '@open-condo/bridge'

import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

export default function App ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps): React.ReactNode {
    useEffect(() => {
        bridge.send('CondoWebAppGetLaunchParams').then(data => {
            console.log(data.condoLocale)  // Set intl locale if you have some
            if (cookies().get('currentUserId')?.value !== data.condoUserId) {
                // Start auth process
            }
        }).catch((error) => {
            // Retry or begin auth process
        })
    }, [])

    return (
        <Component {...pageProps} />
    )
}
```
