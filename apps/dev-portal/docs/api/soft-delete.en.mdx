In most models, we do not use hard object deletion.
This is done to facilitate deleted data recovery cases.
Instead, we mark objects as deleted using the `deletedAt` service attribute.

## Deleting an object

To delete an object - we need to update it by putting in the `deletedAt` attribute to the current time in ISO format. Example:
```
mutation {
  updateOrganization(id: "5cb19b4a-a215-466e-8214-01c24942d962", data: { deletedAt: "2023-06-02T11:38:25Z" }) {
    id
  }
}
```


## Retrieving non-deleted data

You don't have to do anything to get only non-deleted objects from the query :)
By default, we exclude deleted objects from the output.

## Retrieving deleted objects

In order to get all the objects, including the deleted ones, in the query address, it is necessary to add the query-parameter `deleted=true`.

To filter objects you use the filters on the `deletedAt` field.
So, for example, this is what the query looks like for all deleted contacts of the residents that are attached to the non-deleted houses.
```
{
  allContacts (where: {
    deletedAt_not: null
    property: { deletedAt: null }
  }) {
    id
    property {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

The URL of the request looks like this: https://condo.d.doma.ai/admin/api?deleted=true
