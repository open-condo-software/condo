## About data version

In all API methods we use the `dv` parameter - the version of the data being sent.
This parameter allows us to maintain API backward compatibility in cases
when a method significantly changes its signature or the signature of its return value.
In that case, we can determine the version of the API used by the client by the value of the `dv` parameter

<Alert type={'info'}>
    At the moment none of our model has had significant changes,
    so always use `dv = 1` as the value of this parameter in your queries.
