# Protected branch figma/tokens serves as storage for figma-tokens plugin and aggregate tokens updates
# This action rebases it on top of origin/master branch and pushes result in figma/promotion branch
# So PR opening / updating can be triggered and after that merged without any conflicts
# NOTE 1: Squash policy is not allowed here, since it generates rebasing conflicts
# NOTE 2: Using PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN, since actions with GITHUB_TOKEN cannot start other actions in CI chain
