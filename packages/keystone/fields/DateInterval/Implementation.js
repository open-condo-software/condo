    P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation.

        - M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of calendar months.
        - W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
        - D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of calendar days.
    T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
        - H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
        - M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
        - S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

    For example, "P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S" represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds".
