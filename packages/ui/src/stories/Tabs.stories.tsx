        children: <Typography.Paragraph>Once upon a time there was a dinosaur called Archie. Archie was not like all the other dinosaurs, he was extraordinarily beautiful! His green scales were brighter than the leaves in the forest in springtime. His eyes were sparkling like glitter, and when he opened his wide mouth, shiny white teeth were visible. Archie liked to live in the backwoods, where the sunlight filtered through the green crown of the trees. Most of all, he liked to bask in the sun and hold his head high to get plenty of vitamin D. All the animals that came his way looked at him with wonder and admiration. They knew that no one had ever seen such a beautiful dinosaur. Archie, on the other hand, was proud of his beauty and enjoyed every minute of his life. Then one day, Archie heard that a little dinosaur was in trouble. This little guy was stuck in a thick bush, and no one could help him. Archie didn&apos;t hesitate and rushed to help. When he ran to the spot, he immediately knew how to help him. He gently pulled the baby out of the bushes, and brought it to its mum. The dinosaur&apos;s mum was extremely grateful, and thanked Archie with honey.  And from that day on, all the animals in the forest began to appreciate Archie&apos;s beauty, not only for his looks, but also for what a wonderful friend and protector he was.   Archie continued to live in his beloved forest, enjoying life and his beauty, and was always ready to help anyone who needed him.</Typography.Paragraph>,
