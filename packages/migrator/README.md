## Local usage

You can use package in your [condo](https://github.com/open-condo-software/condo) monorepo fork 
by running the following command to build package:
```bash
yarn workspace @open-condo/migrator build
```
And then the one to run it:
```bash
npx @open-condo/migrator --help
```

## Remote usage

### Without installation

You can use migrator on remote instances without installing additional packages by running:
```bash
npx @open-condo/migrator@latest --help
```

### With installation

Or alternatively you can install it with:
```bash
yarn add -D @open-condo/migrator
```

And then run with:
```bash
npx @open-condo/migrator --help
```

## How to run migration commands

### List of commands and arguments

You can use the following command to explore list of all available commands:
```bash
npx @open-condo/migrator --help
```

Then you can explore command arguments / description by running the following:
```bash
npx @open-condo/migrator <command> --help
```

### Running command locally

You can migrate whole monorepo by running command from monorepo root. For example:

```bash
npx @open-condo/migrator add-apps-kv-prefixes
```

Or you can more precisely run it for single / multiple apps:

```bash
npx @open-condo/migrator add-apps-kv-prefixes -f condo address-service
```

### Running command on remote environments

You can also run migration commands on deployed applications where access `.env` files is not possible, 
since environment variables are passed from external tools and apps are deployed "one per pod".

For this scenarios you can migrate single app at a time by running commands like this:

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://remote_user:*******@127.0.0.1:6379/6 npx @open-condo/migrator add-apps-kv-prefixes -f condo
```

> NOTE: You can remove REDIS_URL=** part if environment variables are already set (from `export` or other external tool)

You can also run migrator from specific app folder instead of using `--filter` arg:

```bash
cd apps/condo
npx @open-condo/migrator add-apps-kv-prefixes
```


## Available commands

### `add-apps-kv-prefixes`

This command will add `keyPrefix` to all your keys of your KV database (Redis).

For example, for `condo` app new keys will look like this:

- `my_key` -> `condo:my_key`
- `sess:asd123ghj` -> `condo:sess:asd123ghj`
- `bull:low:importMeters:123` -> `{condo:bull:low}:importMeters:123`
