## Installation

### Peer dependencies
> **NOTE**: This package uses `react` / `react-dom` and `@apollo/client` as its peer dependencies,
> so make sure you've got ones installed. 
> 
> You should have no trouble with any react version having a hooks,
> but we're testing on versions `>=16`. 
> 
> Any apollo `3.x.x` should be fine too, but all utils are tested on `^3.11.8`
> 
> - `react` / `react-dom` are required for `/hooks/**` and `/components/**` entry points
> - `@apollo/client` is required for `/helpers/apollo.ts`
> 
> You can skip installing them if you don't use these utilities, as each utility is built separately, 
> but we highly recommend leaving them installed
