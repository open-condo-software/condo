Contributions are always welcome. Please follow the next recommendations:

3. [Test new code](#testing) locally
4. Push your new branch to origin
5. Then create a pull request to the `main` branch.

## Testing

Unit test files should be named `[filename].test.js`. We use Jest for testing.

To start tests locally:

2. run `yarn dev` in separated terminal
3. run `yarn worker` in separated terminal
4. run `yarn test`
